# Simple Academic Example of Node Communication

This repository contains a **simple academic example** demonstrating basic interaction between two nodes: **Node B** and **Node A**. The goal is to clearly and efficiently showcase a basic communication flow without unnecessary complexity.

## Execution Instructions

> ⚠️ **Important**: This example has been simplified for fast and lightweight execution. **Triple generation is excluded** to minimize processing time and complexity.

### Steps:

1. **Run Node B first**  
   Node B must be running and listening before Node A attempts to connect.

   ```bash
   python node_b.py
   ```

2. **Then run Node A**  
   Once Node B is active, you can launch Node A.

   ```bash
   python node_a.py
   ```

## Description

- This example represents a basic scenario where Node A communicates with Node B.
- No semantic processing or complex inference is performed.
- Ideal for **educational purposes** or as a **starter template** for more advanced experiments.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (only standard modules are used).
